### **Correct Information about FOERSTER's BARPROOF**

**FOERSTER's BARPROOF** is an advanced **ultrasonic testing (UT)** system designed for the non-destructive testing of metallic bars and rods. Unlike eddy current testing (ECT) or magnetic flux leakage (MFL), which are indeed core competencies of Institut Dr. Foerster under different product names, the BARPROOF system utilizes ultrasonic technology to detect **internal defects** within the entire cross-section of the material.

---

### **Measurement Principle:**

#### **Ultrasonic Testing (UT):**

1. **Generation of Ultrasonic Waves:**
   - The BARPROOF system uses ultrasonic transducers to emit high-frequency sound waves into the metal bar.

2. **Propagation Through Material:**
   - These ultrasonic waves travel through the material, penetrating the entire cross-section.

3. **Interaction with Defects:**
   - When the waves encounter internal anomalies like cracks, voids, or inclusions, part of the energy is reflected back to the transducer.

4. **Detection of Reflected Signals:**
   - The transducer or separate receiving sensors detect these reflected ultrasonic signals.

5. **Signal Analysis:**
   - The system analyzes the time it takes for the echoes to return and their amplitudes to determine the location and size of internal defects.

### **Key Features:**

- **Full-Volume Inspection:**
  - Capable of detecting internal defects throughout the entire cross-section of the bar, not just surface flaws.

- **High Throughput:**
  - Designed for high-speed inspection, making it suitable for integration into production lines without causing delays.

- **Automated Operation:**
  - Offers automated scanning, data acquisition, and evaluation, reducing the need for manual intervention.

- **Adjustable Parameters:**
  - Inspection settings can be customized based on material type, bar dimensions, and specific quality standards.

- **Data Recording and Visualization:**
  - Provides detailed reports and visual representations of detected defects for quality control and documentation.

---

### **Applications:**

- **Metal Production and Processing:**
  - Quality assurance during the manufacturing of steel, aluminum, and other metal bars and rods.

- **Automotive and Aerospace Industries:**
  - Inspection of critical components where internal integrity is essential for safety and performance.

- **Energy Sector:**
  - Evaluation of bars and rods used in power generation equipment, including turbines and generators.

- **Construction and Infrastructure:**
  - Ensuring the reliability of structural components in buildings, bridges, and other infrastructure projects.

### **Institut Dr. Foerster's Other NDT Products Using Eddy Currents and Magnetic Flux Leakage:**

You are correct that Institut Dr. Foerster specializes in eddy current testing and magnetic flux leakage methods, but these techniques are employed in other products:

#### **Eddy Current Testing Systems:**

- **DEFECTOMAT®:**
  - An eddy current testing system for detecting surface defects in wires, bars, and tubes.
  - Ideal for high-speed inspection in production environments.
  
- **DEFECTOSCOP®:**
  - A portable eddy current flaw detector used for manual inspection tasks.
  - Suitable for detecting cracks and other surface defects in conductive materials.

#### **Magnetic Flux Leakage Systems:**

- **CIRCOFLUX®:**
  - Designed for detecting longitudinal and transverse defects in ferromagnetic steel bars and tubes.
  - Utilizes magnetic flux leakage to identify flaws beneath the surface.

- **MAGNATEST®:**
  - An electromagnetic induction testing system for assessing material properties like hardness, structure, and alloy composition.

---

### **Why BARPROOF Uses Ultrasonic Testing:**

- **Detection of Internal Defects:**
  - Ultrasonic testing is highly effective for identifying internal anomalies that eddy current and magnetic flux leakage methods might not detect, as ECT is more surface-sensitive and MFL is mainly used for near-surface defects.

- **Material Versatility:**
  - UT can be used on a variety of materials, including both ferrous and non-ferrous metals.

---

### **Conclusion:**

**FOERSTER's BARPROOF** is an ultrasonic testing system specifically designed to detect internal defects in metallic bars and rods. It complements Institut Dr. Foerster's range of non-destructive testing solutions by offering capabilities that eddy current and magnetic flux leakage methods do not provide.
