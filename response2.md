As of my knowledge cutoff in October 2023, the **34th Chaos Communication Congress (34C3)** took place from December 27 to December 30, 2017, in Leipzig, Germany. One of the talks at this event was titled **"Low-Cost Non-Invasive Biomedical Imaging."**

### **Overview of the Talk:**

The presentation focused on accessible and affordable methods for biomedical imaging that do not require invasive procedures. The key points likely included:

- **Open-Source Imaging Solutions:**
  - Development of low-cost hardware and software for medical imaging.
  - Use of open-source platforms like Arduino or Raspberry Pi to build imaging devices.

- **Repurposing Consumer Electronics:**
  - Utilizing everyday devices such as smartphones or webcams for biomedical imaging.
  - Techniques to enhance the capabilities of these devices for medical purposes.

- **Non-Invasive Techniques:**
  - Exploration of imaging methods that do not require surgery or internal probes.
  - Possible focus on modalities like ultrasound, optical imaging, or infrared thermography.

- **Applications in Resource-Limited Settings:**
  - Addressing the need for affordable medical imaging in developing countries.
  - Strategies to overcome the lack of access to expensive medical equipment.

- **Ethical and Privacy Considerations:**
  - Discussing the implications of DIY medical devices on patient privacy and data security.
  - Navigating regulatory challenges associated with non-certified medical equipment.

### **Relevance and Impact:**

- **Democratizing Medical Technology:**
  - The talk likely emphasized making medical imaging accessible to a wider audience.
  - Encouraging community involvement in developing and improving low-cost solutions.

- **Innovation in Healthcare:**
  - Showcasing how hacking and maker culture can contribute to advancements in medical technology.
  - Inspiring collaborations between technologists, engineers, and healthcare professionals.

### **Possible Demonstrations:**

- **Live Prototypes:**
  - The speaker may have presented working prototypes of low-cost imaging devices.
  - Demonstrations on how to assemble and use these devices effectively.

- **Case Studies:**
  - Sharing success stories or pilot projects where such technology made a tangible difference.
  - Highlighting challenges faced during development and deployment.

### **Further Exploration:**

- **Community Involvement:**
  - Encouraging attendees to participate in open-source projects related to biomedical imaging.
  - Providing resources or guidelines for those interested in contributing.

- **Workshops and Collaborations:**
  - Possibly organizing hands-on sessions or hackathons during or after the congress.
  - Building networks among professionals and enthusiasts in the field.

### **Conclusion:**

The "Low-Cost Non-Invasive Biomedical Imaging" talk at 34C3 likely served as an inspiring example of how technology and innovation can address critical needs in healthcare. By focusing on affordability and accessibility, it highlighted the potential for community-driven solutions to make a significant impact, especially in under-resourced areas.
