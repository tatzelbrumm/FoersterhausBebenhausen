**Introduction**

Fluxgate sensors are highly sensitive magnetometers used to measure low-intensity magnetic fields with precision. They operate by driving a ferromagnetic core into saturation using an excitation current and detecting changes in the magnetic field through secondary windings. Modeling such devices in SPICE (Simulation Program with Integrated Circuit Emphasis) requires an accurate representation of the ferromagnetic core's non-linear magnetic properties, including saturation and hysteresis effects.

### **Modeling Ferromagnetic Cores in SPICE**

Modeling ferromagnetic cores in SPICE involves capturing the core's magnetic behavior, particularly its non-linear relationship between magnetic flux and magnetomotive force (MMF). Here are approaches to create a SPICE model for ferromagnetic cores used in fluxgates:

---

#### **1. Non-Linear Inductor Models**

SPICE allows the creation of non-linear inductors whose inductance varies with current. This is essential for simulating saturation effects in ferromagnetic cores.

- **Gyrator-Capacitor Approach:**
  
  Represent the inductor using a gyrator-capacitor model, where the magnetic core is modeled using a non-linear capacitor whose capacitance represents the inverse of the permeability.

- **Polynomial or Table-Defined Inductance:**

  Use a current-dependent inductance defined by a polynomial or a look-up table (LUT):

  ```spice
  .param a1 = [coefficients]
  Lcore n1 n2 L = L0 + a1*I(Lcore) + a2*I(Lcore)**2 + ...
  ```

---

#### **2. Saturable Core Model**

Some SPICE variants, like **LTspice**, provide a built-in saturable core model:

- **Defining a Saturable Inductor:**

  ```spice
  Lcore n1 n2 Lm
  Bcore n1 n2 I = phi(Lcore)
  .model CoreMod Core(Lm=... [other parameters])
  ```

- **Parameters:**

  - **Lm:** Unsaturated inductance.
  - **AL:** Inductance factor.
  - **Isat:** Saturation current.
  - **Flux Density (B) and Field Strength (H):** For detailed modeling.

---

#### **3. Hysteresis Modeling**

To include hysteresis effects, which are significant in ferromagnetic cores:

- **Jiles-Atherton Model:**

  Implement the Jiles-Atherton hysteresis model using behavioral modeling or external functions. This model describes the magnetization \( M \) as a function of the magnetic field \( H \):

  \[
  M(H) = M_s \left[ \coth\left( \frac{H + \alpha M}{a} \right) - \frac{a}{H + \alpha M} \right]
  \]

  Where:
  - \( M_s \): Saturation magnetization.
  - \( a \): Shape parameter.
  - \( \alpha \): Interdomain coupling.

- **Preisach Model:**

  The Preisach model represents hysteresis as a superposition of elementary hysteresis operators (hysterons). This can be complex to implement in SPICE but provides accurate hysteresis simulation.

- **Verilog-A Modules:**

  Use Verilog-A to code custom hysteresis behavior and include it in SPICE simulations.

---

#### **4. Behavioral Modeling with Controlled Sources**

- **Use Voltage and Current-Controlled Sources:**

  Model non-linear relationships using `E`, `F`, `G`, and `H` elements:

  ```spice
  Gcore n1 n2 expr = f(V(n1,n2), I(Lcore))
  ```

- **Flux Calculation:**

  Calculate magnetic flux \( \Phi \) as:

  \[
  \Phi = \int V \, dt
  \]

  And relate it to current \( I \) through a non-linear function representing the core's \( B-H \) curve.

---

### **Modeling a Fluxgate Sensor in SPICE**

A fluxgate sensor typically consists of:

- **Drive Winding (Excitation Coil):** Applies an alternating magnetic field to drive the core into saturation.
- **Sense Winding (Pickup Coil):** Detects changes in the magnetic field due to external influences.

#### **1. Drive Winding Modeling**

- **Excitation Source:**

  Apply a sine wave voltage source to the drive winding:

  ```spice
  Vdrive n1 0 SIN(0 {Vamp} {Freq})
  ```

- **Non-Linear Inductor:**

  Model the drive winding with a non-linear inductor that includes saturation effects:

  ```spice
  Ldrive n1 n2 L = L(I(Ldrive))
  ```

- **Inductance Function:**

  Define the inductance \( L(I) \) to decrease as current increases (saturation):

  ```spice
  .func L(I) = {L0 / (1 + (I/Isat)^n)}
  ```

  Where:
  - \( L0 \): Initial inductance.
  - \( Isat \): Saturation current.
  - \( n \): Sharpness of saturation.

#### **2. Sense Winding Modeling**

- **Mutual Inductance:**

  Define coupling between drive and sense windings:

  ```spice
  Lsense n3 n4 Ls
  K1 Ldrive Lsense {k}
  ```

  Where:
  - \( Ls \): Inductance of the sense winding.
  - \( k \): Coupling coefficient (close to 1 for tight coupling).

- **Load Resistance:**

  Include a resistor to model the measurement instrument:

  ```spice
  Rsense n4 0 {Rload}
  ```

#### **3. Core Material Properties**

- **Include Hysteresis (Optional):**

  For more accuracy, incorporate hysteresis using a behavioral model or custom component.

- **External Magnetic Field:**

  Model the effect of an external magnetic field \( H_{\text{ext}} \) by adding a current source or modifying the core's magnetization:

  ```spice
  Bext n1 n2 V = f(Hext)
  ```

### **Example SPICE Netlist**

Here's a simplified SPICE netlist for a fluxgate sensor:

```spice
* Drive winding parameters
.param Vamp = 10V
.param Freq = 10kHz
.param L0 = 10mH
.param Isat = 100mA
.param n = 2

* Sense winding parameters
.param Ls = 100uH
.param k = 0.99
.param Rload = 1k

* Drive winding inductance function
.func Ldrive(I) = {L0 / (1 + (I/Isat)^n)}

* Drive winding
Vdrive n1 0 SIN(0 {Vamp} {Freq})
Ldrive n1 n2 L = Ldrive(I(Ldrive))

* Sense winding
Lsense n3 n4 {Ls}
K1 Ldrive Lsense {k}

* Load on sense winding
Rsense n4 0 {Rload}

* External magnetic field effect (simplified)
Iext n2 n0 AC 0 DC {Iext}

* Simulation control
.tran 0 1m 0 1u
.probe V(n4)
.end
```

**Notes:**

- **Iext** represents the effect of an external magnetic field. In practice, this requires a more detailed model.
- **Ldrive** uses a non-linear function to simulate saturation.
- **K1** defines the mutual coupling between the windings.

### **Considerations for Accurate Modeling**

- **Non-Linearity and Saturation:**

  Accurately modeling saturation is crucial. The inductance should reflect the core's \( B-H \) curve.

- **Hysteresis Effects:**

  For applications sensitive to hysteresis, include a hysteresis model. This may require custom modeling or using advanced SPICE features.

- **Temperature Dependence:**

  Core properties can vary with temperature. Include temperature coefficients if necessary.

- **Frequency Response:**

  Ensure that the model is valid over the frequency range of interest, especially if simulating high-frequency excitation.

---

### **Advanced Modeling Techniques**

- **Using Verilog-A:**

  Implement custom magnetic models using Verilog-A for more flexibility and accuracy.

- **Specialized Simulation Tools:**

  Consider electromagnetic simulation software (e.g., Ansys Maxwell, COMSOL Multiphysics) for complex models involving 3D field interactions.

- **Macro Models:**

  Create macro models that encapsulate the core behavior, simplifying simulation while retaining essential characteristics.

### **Conclusion**

Modeling ferromagnetic cores for fluxgate sensors in SPICE involves representing the core's non-linear magnetic properties, including saturation and, if necessary, hysteresis. By using non-linear inductance functions, mutual coupling definitions, and considering the core's \( B-H \) characteristics, you can simulate the fluxgate's operation and analyze its response to external magnetic fields.

While SPICE has limitations in handling complex magnetic phenomena, careful modeling and the use of behavioral elements or custom code can provide valuable insights into the device's performance. For highly accurate or specialized applications, combining SPICE simulations with other modeling tools or experimental validation is recommended.
