**FOERSTER's BARPROOF** is a non-destructive testing (NDT) system developed by **Institut Dr. Foerster**, designed specifically for the inspection of metallic bars and rods. It is engineered to detect surface and near-surface defects such as cracks, inclusions, seams, and other irregularities that can affect the integrity and performance of metal products.

### **Measurement Principle:**

**BARPROOF** primarily operates based on the principles of **eddy current testing (ECT)** and, in some configurations, **magnetic flux leakage (MFL)**. Here's how it works:

1. **Eddy Current Testing:**
   - **Generation of Magnetic Field:**
     - The system generates an alternating magnetic field using coils or probes.
   - **Induction of Eddy Currents:**
     - As a metal bar passes through this magnetic field, it induces circulating currents (eddy currents) within the conductive material.
   - **Interaction with Defects:**
     - Defects disrupt the flow of eddy currents, causing changes in the electromagnetic response.
   - **Detection:**
     - Sensors detect these changes, which are then analyzed to identify the presence and characteristics of defects.

2. **Magnetic Flux Leakage (for Ferromagnetic Materials):**
   - **Magnetization:**
     - The bar is magnetized using strong permanent magnets or electromagnets.
   - **Leakage Fields at Defects:**
     - Defects in the material cause a leakage of the magnetic field outside the metal surface.
   - **Detection:**
     - Sensors detect these leakage fields, indicating the location and size of the defects.

### **Operation Workflow:**

1. **Setup:**
   - The BARPROOF system is configured according to the size and material of the bars to be inspected.

2. **Calibration:**
   - The system is calibrated using reference samples with known defects to set sensitivity levels.

3. **Inspection:**
   - Bars are fed through the inspection unit, where they pass through electromagnetic fields.

4. **Detection:**
   - Sensors detect disruptions in eddy currents or magnetic flux leakage caused by defects.

5. **Analysis:**
   - The system processes the sensor signals to determine the presence, location, and size of defects.

6. **Sorting:**
   - Defective bars are automatically sorted out or marked for further evaluation.
