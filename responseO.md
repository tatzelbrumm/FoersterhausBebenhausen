You're absolutely correct that replacing step functions with **smooth transitions** like **hyperbolic tangents** or **Fermi functions** can improve convergence in simulations. Step functions are often problematic in SPICE simulators because of their abrupt, discontinuous nature. Smooth functions like the **tanh** (hyperbolic tangent) function offer a more stable alternative because they provide continuous derivatives, which helps the simulator converge more easily.

Letâ€™s rewrite the **Preisach model** using the **tanh** function in place of the step functions. The **tanh** function provides a smooth transition between -1 and 1, and it can be used to model the switching behavior of each hysteron.

### **Modified Preisach Model Using `tanh` for Smooth Transitions**

The general idea is to replace the `if()` statements (which behave like step functions) with the following smooth transition formula:

\[
\text{smooth\_switch}(x) = \tanh(g \cdot (x - V_{th}))
\]

- \( g \) is a gain factor that controls the steepness of the transition.
- \( V_{th} \) is the threshold voltage at which the hysteron switches.

The **tanh** function will provide a smooth transition centered around \( V_{th} \), and the steepness of this transition is controlled by the gain \( g \).

---

### **Step-by-Step Implementation Using `tanh`**

1. **Smooth Hysteron Model with `tanh`:**

For each hysteron, we replace the step function logic with a smooth transition using `tanh`.

For a single hysteron with upper threshold \( V_{th+} \) and lower threshold \( V_{th-} \), the switching behavior can be described as:

\[
y(V_{in}) = \frac{1}{2} \left( \tanh(g \cdot (V_{in} - V_{th+})) - \tanh(g \cdot (V_{in} - V_{th-})) \right)
\]

- This expression gives a smooth transition between -1 and 1 as the input \( V_{in} \) crosses the thresholds \( V_{th+} \) and \( V_{th-} \).
- The parameter \( g \) controls the steepness of the transition.

2. **LTspice Implementation for a Single Hysteron:**

```spice
* Parameters for the smooth transition
.param Vthp = 0.5    ; Upper threshold
.param Vthn = -0.5   ; Lower threshold
.param g = 20        ; Gain for steepness of transition

* Input signal
Vin N001 0 SIN(0 1 1k)

* Smooth hysteron using tanh for smooth transitions
Bhysteron N002 0 V = 0.5 * (tanh({g} * (V(N001) - {Vthp})) - tanh({g} * (V(N001) - {Vthn})))
```

In this model:
- The **tanh** functions provide smooth transitions for the hysteron state between -1 and 1.
- The parameter **g** controls the steepness of the switching behavior. Higher values of **g** make the transition steeper, while lower values make it more gradual.

3. **Superposition of Multiple Hysterons:**

As in the original model, we need to add multiple hysterons with different thresholds to build the complete Preisach model. Each hysteron has its own set of thresholds, and the total hysteresis response is the sum of all individual hysterons.

```spice
* Parameters for multiple hysterons
.param Vthp1 = 0.6
.param Vthn1 = -0.6
.param Vthp2 = 0.7
.param Vthn2 = -0.7
.param g = 20  ; Gain for all hysterons

* Input signal
Vin N001 0 SIN(0 1 1k)

* First smooth hysteron
Bhysteron1 N002 0 V = 0.5 * (tanh({g} * (V(N001) - {Vthp1})) - tanh({g} * (V(N001) - {Vthn1})))

* Second smooth hysteron
Bhysteron2 N003 0 V = 0.5 * (tanh({g} * (V(N001) - {Vthp2})) - tanh({g} * (V(N001) - {Vthn2})))

* Total hysteresis response (sum of individual hysterons)
Btotal N004 0 V = V(N002) + V(N003)

* Simulation command and plotting
.tran 0 10m
.plot TRAN V(N004) V(N001)
```

In this modified model:
- We use two hysterons (`Bhysteron1` and `Bhysteron2`), each with different thresholds.
- The total hysteresis response `Btotal` is the sum of the outputs of all hysterons.

---

### **How the `tanh`-based Hysteron Works:**

- **Smooth Transition:** The `tanh` function provides a smooth transition between states, making the model more stable and less prone to convergence issues in LTspice compared to step functions.
- **Parameter \( g \):** The gain parameter \( g \) controls the sharpness of the transition. A high \( g \) value makes the transition steeper (closer to a step function), while a lower \( g \) value makes it smoother.

---

### **Fine-Tuning the Model:**

1. **Steepness Control:**
   - The value of \( g \) determines how steep the transition is between -1 and 1. For most applications, a value of \( g \) around **20** works well. You can experiment with different values to get the desired behavior.

2. **Thresholds:**
   - Adjust the thresholds \( V_{th+} \) and \( V_{th-} \) to control where each hysteron switches.

3. **Adding More Hysterons:**
   - For a more complex and realistic Preisach model, you can add more hysterons with different thresholds. The more hysterons you add, the more accurate the model becomes in representing real hysteresis loops.

4. **Gain for Each Hysteron:**
   - You can modify the gain for each hysteron to represent different contributions from different hysterons.

---

### **Example: Three Hysterons with Different Thresholds**

```spice
* Parameters for multiple hysterons
.param Vthp1 = 0.6
.param Vthn1 = -0.6
.param Vthp2 = 0.7
.param Vthn2 = -0.7
.param Vthp3 = 0.8
.param Vthn3 = -0.8
.param g = 20  ; Gain for steepness of transition

* Input signal
Vin N001 0 SIN(0 1 1k)

* First hysteron using tanh for smooth transitions
Bhysteron1 N002 0 V = 0.5 * (tanh({g} * (V(N001) - {Vthp1})) - tanh({g} * (V(N001) - {Vthn1})))

* Second hysteron
Bhysteron2 N003 0 V = 0.5 * (tanh({g} * (V(N001) - {Vthp2})) - tanh({g} * (V(N001) - {Vthn2})))

* Third hysteron
Bhysteron3 N005 0 V = 0.5 * (tanh({g} * (V(N001) - {Vthp3})) - tanh({g} * (V(N001) - {Vthn3})))

* Total hysteresis response
Btotal N004 0 V = V(N002) + V(N003) + V(N005)

* Simulation command and plotting
.tran 0 10m
.plot TRAN V(N004) V(N001)
```

This model now includes three hysterons with different threshold values. The total output `Btotal` will represent the cumulative hysteresis response.

### **Benefits of Using `tanh`:**

1. **Improved Convergence:**
   - The smooth transitions provided by the `tanh` function help improve convergence in SPICE simulations, avoiding the sharp jumps of step functions.

2. **Adjustable Steepness:**
   - By controlling the gain parameter \( g \), you can adjust how gradual or sharp the transition between hysteron states is, allowing more control over the behavior of the model.

3. **Flexibility:**
   - This approach is flexible and can easily be expanded by adding more hysterons to approximate more complex hysteresis loops.

---

### **Conclusion:**

Using **`tanh` functions** to model the hysterons in the Preisach model significantly improves convergence in LTspice simulations while still providing accurate hysteresis behavior. The **smooth transitions** of the `tanh` function eliminate the abrupt jumps of step functions, leading to more stable and reliable simulations.

You can further tune the model by adjusting the thresholds and gain parameters, and by adding more hysterons to increase the accuracy of the hysteresis loop representation.
